### Existing Problems:

The Graph Neural Networks are designed to learn node representations on homogeneous graphs. However, for heterogeneous graph, existing solutions are either ignore the nodes types or 
manually setting of meta-paths.

### GTN advantages:

No domain-specific graph preprocessing is required.
